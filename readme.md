# Person-Re-ID

In this project, we will release our deep person re-identification (Re-ID) implementation based on caffe. In the examples file, you can find the corresponding
algorithms, which are introduced as follows:

# 1. P2S
Three main contributions are made in this paper: 1) A part-based deep neural network is designed for person Re-ID; 2) A point to set metric is introduced to supervise feature learning; 3) A symmetric triplet loss function is formulated to jointly minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance.
